Strategy Name:
Smart Money Liquidity Reversal

Core Thesis:
Exploit retail crowd behavior by trading against stop hunts and fakeouts, with the market makers, at high-liquidity inflection points—using real-time data on liquidations, funding, open interest, and price structure.

Signal Logic:
Liquidity Sweep Detection

Continuously monitor recent swing highs/lows, round numbers, and order book liquidity clusters.

Detect rapid price moves (wicks) through these levels, accompanied by a surge in liquidations or open interest.

Confirmation of Reversal

After the liquidity sweep, check if price quickly reclaims the swept level (i.e., closes back above/below).

Look for signs of order book absorption (e.g., large sell walls after a wick down, or buy walls after a wick up).

Market Sentiment Filtering

Check funding rates and open interest:

If funding is extremely positive, favor short trades; if negative, favor long trades.

Confirm that open interest spikes in the direction of the move (suggests trapped traders).

Entry & Risk Management

Enter countertrend only after confirmation (not on the wick alone).

Set stop-loss just beyond the liquidity sweep (outside the wick/extreme).

Target mean reversion to the range midpoint, VWAP, or previous support/resistance.

No Signal = No Trade

If confirmation doesn’t come within a short window, ignore the move—this avoids chasing failed signals.

Implementation Outline:
Inputs Required:

Real-time price feed, liquidation feed, open interest, funding rates, and order book data.

Bot Process:

Identify key liquidity levels dynamically.

Detect sweeps and record liquidation spikes or OI surges.

Wait for price to reclaim the level (quick reversal).

Filter with sentiment data (funding, OI).

If all conditions align, execute entry with tight stop.

Monitor trade and exit at defined profit targets or upon reversal signs.

Risk Management:
Limit risk per trade (e.g., 0.25-0.5% of account).

Never average down or up on losing positions.

Use a trade cooldown after a stop-out or streak of losses.

Edge Over Retail:
This approach exploits the classic mistakes of retail traders (FOMO, panic selling, stop placement), while aligning with market maker logic—fading extremes, not chasing moves.
